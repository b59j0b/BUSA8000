1. Data Cleaning and WranglingDescribe and show the data cleaning, transformation and wrangling process’ that you have completed. Ensure you provide justification of any data handling and transformation you have completed.
you can embed your transfomration code and provide justification like this:
example: This code creates x and y variable, i have created these variable so that i can add these to my data frame. and compute the required measures. Please remember to use comments in your code.x <-   1:10            # create an x variable
y <-   10:1            # create a y variable
dataf <-   data.frame(x =   x, y =   y)
summary(dataf)##                      x                                           y
